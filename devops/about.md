Hello!

I'm currently working in the Data team at Scripbox, Bangalore. My interests primarily include Bayesian Statistics, Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Previously, I used to work at Zopper in the backend team.

I'm working on variations of the Customer Lifetime Value model using PyMC3. I also have experience in the field of DevOps and Data Engineering and have helped build end-to-end pipeline solutions for the organizations. My leisure time is spend reading fiction and playing football.
